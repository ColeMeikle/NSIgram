This is a basic social media messaging website made as a APCS 12 final project.

Database variables in Database.java are hidden, so you would need to provide your own Database url, user, and password to run it locally.

This project is currently live at nsigram.onrender.com, but it takes a few minutes to load the page for the first time because of how render hosts free websites.
